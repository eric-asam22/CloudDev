# There are two CloudFormation stacks: StackA and StackB.

# In StackA, there are is an S3 bucket with its name.
# In StackB, you want to read the bucketname from StackA and use it to configure another resource (e.g., an Amazon EC2 instance).

# Your task is to provide the CloudFormation snippet for StackA and StackB that achieves the desired functionality as described above.
